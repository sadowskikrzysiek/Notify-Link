# Notify-Link
Notify Link is a system consisting of 3 projects. Its assumption is to enable building a social network based on the exchange of information provided in the form of notifications. Ultimately, notifications will be able to be added in two modes, i.e. immediate and scheduled. The adopted solution will provide many opportunities to use this tool, from quickly inviting team members to a coffee or table football break, to planning meetings or commissioning new tasks. The current version of the system includes the following applications: Â -Notify Link- allows users to manage their account, friends and notifications from the browser position. -Notify Link Rest-Web Service enabling clients to communicate with the server using the REST API. -Notify Link Client- A mobile application for the Android platform, which is a REST API client. It is through it that users will receive notifications. In the current version, the application supports the API up to version 25. Currently, the system only supports instant notifications.
